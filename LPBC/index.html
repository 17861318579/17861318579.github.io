<b>1. Dataset Description </b>
<br> 
<p style=text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;> 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography has drawn much attention in the medical imaging field. Firstly, we cover the eyeball with a translucent eye patch of a radius of about 8 mm and a collar with a radius of about 1.2 mm, which can prevent the eye patch from peeling off by the mouse's paw. Then, we put the mouse on the box. Making their eyes aim at the probe part of the infrared refractometer, the light can enter into the mouse's eyes. Finally, we can get the image of mouse eye in vivo by SS-OCT system. Due to the limitation of page space and network bandwidth, we resize the images as 512*512 for view. As shown in Fig.1, we can see that the background and foreground of some organs are low-contrast. 
<br>  This dataset will be soon released publicly. The ground-truth samples were manually made by our experts, which are aided with our self-developed software.
